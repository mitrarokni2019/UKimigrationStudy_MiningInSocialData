UK Immigration Study: Mining Social Data
This repository hosts the code and data for our project, "Polarized Framing: A Computational Analysis of Post-Second World War Immigrant Situations in UK Political History Based on Parliamentary Debates."

Description
The project explores UK parliamentary debates on immigration from 1940 to 2024. We investigate how political framing has evolved over time, with a focus on language and polarization. Using computational methods inspired by Card et al. (2022), we analyze large text corpora to classify sentiments and identify trends in political discourse.

Inspiration
This project builds on methods from:

Card et al. (2022): Computational analysis of 140 years of US political speeches reveals more positive but increasingly polarized framing of immigration. Read the paper here
